                            You can collect information about the behaviors, needs, and opinions using surveys. Surveys
                            can
                            be used to find out attitudes and reactions, to measure client satisfaction, to gauge
                            opinions
                            about various issues, and to add credibility to your research. Surveys are a primary source
                            of
                            information -- that is, you directly ask someone for a response to a question, rather than
                            using
                            any secondary sources like written records.

                            You can use surveys to measure ideas or opinions about community issues related to your
                            initiative. For example, you may want to know how many people use your services, what users
                            think about your services, what new users expect from your services, and whether users are
                            satisfied with what you provide.

                            Leveling Survey
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Levelling (or Leveling) is a branch of surveying, the object of which is: i) to find the
                            elevations of given points with respect to a given or assumed datum, and ii) to establish
                            points at a given or assumed datum. The first operation is required to enable the works to
                            be designed while the second operation is required in the setting out of allx kinds of
                            engineering works. Levelling deals with measurements in a vertical plane.
                            Level surface: A level surface is defined as a curved surface which at each point is
                            perpendicular to the direction of gravity at the point. The surface of a still water is a
                            truly level surface. Any surface parallel to the mean spheroidal surface of the earth is,
                            therefore, a level surface.

                            Building Survey
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The building survey report tends to cause a lot of confusion and uncertainty...

                            People often don’t know what exactly it is, how much it costs or who it should be conducted
                            by.

                            There are mixed messages over when you do require one and when you don’t require one.

                            There are also question marks over what the building survey report actually means and what
                            should actually be done with it.

                            Well, we hope to provide some answers to the above questions, with the help of Sally Fraser
                            from Stacks Property Search.

                            A building survey, which used to be known as a structural survey, is a comprehensive
                            inspection of all accessible elements of your property.

                            The report also provides a detailed evaluation of the condition of your property and will
                            suggest which parts of the property might be a problem.

                            In addition, the report will point out areas of concern that could need further
                            investigation.

                            Earthwork quantities
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            In this post, we are going to discuss various methods of volume calculation that can be
                            adopted to find earthwork quantities. For various civil engineering projects like road work,
                            irrigation canal project, tank survey, earthmoving, etc., the calculation method used is
                            different. Some of these methods were introduced before the invention of computers and are
                            still being continued. This document discusses the industry practices of various methods of
                            volume calculation so that the readers can finally choose the right one for their project.

                            Earthworks are engineering works created through the moving and/or processing of massive
                            quantities of soil or unformed rock. Earthwork is done to reconfigure the topography of a
                            site to achieve the design levels. Earthwork involves cutting and filling to achieve the
                            required topography.

                        <p>
                            Contouring in surveying is the determination of elevation of various points on the ground
                            and fixing these points of same horizontal positions in the contour map.

                            To exercise vertical control leveling work is carried out and simultaneously to exercise
                            horizontal control chain survey or compass survey or plane table survey is to be carried
                            out.

                            If the theodolite is used, both horizontal and vertical controls can be achieved from the
                            same instrument. Based on the instruments used one can classify the contouring in different
                            groups.

                            Learning and development is necessary in our lives: at home or at work, to find a better
                            job, or to enhance our skills. Much of the learning and development we need in our lives
                            usually requires some sort of training. People will engage in training at some point or
                            another to prepare themselves with a skill they might need to perform a task. Therefore,
                            training often becomes a priority for both an employer and an employee.

                            When you conduct training sessions, it's also important to collect feedback, to assess the
                            effectiveness of the training sessions. Sending out a survey is an effective way to get that
                            feedback. To help you out, we have created a sample template which you can use to measure
                            your training sessions' satisfaction levels.
